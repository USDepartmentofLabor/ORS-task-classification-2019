    "On first glance, it looks like the sk-learn implementation of one-vs-rest is doing very well. But, remember that this implementation doesn't use any sampling methods and our data is highly imbalanced. So it is likely that although the accuracy is high, the model is probably just predicting the \"rest\" class instead of the target class for everything. In other words, there are many true negative, but also no true positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "So next, lets try to implement some sampling techniques that will balance our data. We'll over-sample the target class and under-sample the \"rest\" classes to create a training set that is more even split between the target class and the \"rest\". then, train on this new even dataset. First, lets try with a target class that is the label for a large proportion of the dataset: Handling and Moving Objects.\n",

    "<b> NOTE (08/06/2019) </b> : This sampling method I performed here was before I realized I needed to reformat the data before sampling. This method allows some of the same tasks to leak appear in the training and test sets, but they are labeled with different GWAs. The sampling method used in the final classifier fixes this problem by reformatting the data into \"easy-to-read\" and \"one-hotted\" dataframe. See the task_classification_helper_functions.py for the code for these functions. The code below gives a general idea of the sampling method I ended up using, but isn't implemented correctly. \n",
